 <h4> Q: Difference between Library and Framework</h4>

<div style = "font-size:20px"> Ans:

<h5>Library:</h5>
 <ol>
<li>A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform common tasks or operations.</li>
<li>You have control over your application's flow, and you can choose when and how to use the library's functions or methods.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Framwork:</h5>
<ol>
<li>A framework is a pre-established structure that dictates the flow and architecture of your application.</li>
<li>Your application is built within the framework, and you must adhere to its conventions and guidelines.</li>
</ol>
In summary, libraries provide tools that you can use to perform specific tasks within your application, giving you more control over the structure and flow of your code. Frameworks, on the other hand, provide a structured foundation for building entire applications, with conventions and guidelines that you must follow, which can help speed up development but may limit flexibility.

<h4>Q: What is CDN and Why Do we use it?</h4>
<div style = "font-size:20px"> 
Ans:A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of geographically distributed servers that work together to provide fast and efficient delivery of web content, such as images, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and other assets, to users. CDNs are used to improve the performance, reliability, and scalability of web applications and websites.

<h5>1. Faster Content Delivery:</h5>
<p>CDNs store copies of web content on servers in multiple locations around the world. When a user requests a web page or resource, the CDN can serve it from the server closest to the user. This reduces latency and speeds up content delivery, resulting in faster page load times.</p>

<h5>
2. Load Distribution:</h5>
<p>CDNs help distribute the load of delivering content. When a website experiences high traffic, the CDN can handle a significant portion of the requests, reducing the load on the origin server. This prevents server overload and maintains consistent performance.</p>

<h5>3. Improved Availability:</h5>\
<p>CDNs enhance the availability and reliability of web content. If one server in the CDN network becomes unavailable, requests can be automatically routed to other servers that have copies of the content. This redundancy minimizes downtime.</p>

<h5>3. Scalability:</h5>

<p>CDNs are designed to scale with the growth of web traffic. As a website's audience expands, the CDN can efficiently handle increased demand without the need for significant infrastructure changes.</p>

<h5>4. Cost Savings:</h5>
<p>By offloading the delivery of web content to a CDN, websites can reduce the amount of traffic they need to handle on their origin server. This can lead to cost savings in terms of server infrastructure and bandwidth.</p>
