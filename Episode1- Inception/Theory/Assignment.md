 <h4> Q: Difference between Library and Framework</h4>

<div style = "font-size:20px"> Ans:

<h5>Library:</h5>
 <ol>
<li>A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform common tasks or operations.</li>
<li>You have control over your application's flow, and you can choose when and how to use the library's functions or methods.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Framwork:</h5>
<ol>
<li>A framework is a pre-established structure that dictates the flow and architecture of your application.</li>
<li>Your application is built within the framework, and you must adhere to its conventions and guidelines.</li>
</ol>
In summary, libraries provide tools that you can use to perform specific tasks within your application, giving you more control over the structure and flow of your code. Frameworks, on the other hand, provide a structured foundation for building entire applications, with conventions and guidelines that you must follow, which can help speed up development but may limit flexibility.
